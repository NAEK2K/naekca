    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Nick! Currently studying <b>Computer and Internet Security</b> at <b>Carleton University</b>. I've had an
        interest in security and programming ever since I started running game servers when I was younger. That interest
        snowballed into me pursuing a degree in computer science!</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>
    <p>Currently my favorite games are Tekken 7, League of Legends, and Modern Warfare. I love games that have a
        competitive edge to them so I tend to play multiplayer games with a competitive scene.</p>
    <h3>Lifting</h3>
    <p>Been lifting on and off since I was 16 (19 now) and while I've gotten a bit inconsistent since university
        started, it's something that I stick with because of how much it has improved my life. I'd love to be able to
        hit the 1000lb club with my lifts, only 30lbs to go!</p>
    <h3>Cars</h3>
    <p>Been in love with cars ever since I got my first car, a MINI Countryman. One of my criteria for "making it" is to
        own my very own Challenger Hellcat Redeye.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Walking Simulator</h3>
    <p>Technology: C++</p>
    <p>Simple C++ terminal game where you simply walk around on a 10x10 grid. You are the player, the number 1, and you
        collect points, the number 0. The game has no end and has no purpose. This program was not tested on Windows
        yet.</p>
